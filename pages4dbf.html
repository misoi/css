	NEAR Anansi’s miserable little hut there was a fine pal-
ace where lived a very rich man called Nothing. Noth-
ing and Anansi proposed, one day, to go to the
neighbouring town to get some wives. Accordingly,
they set off together.
Nothing, being a rich man, wore a very fine vel-
vet cloth, while Anansi had a ragged cotton one. While
they were on their way Anansi persuaded Nothing to
change clothes for a little while, promising to give back
the fine velvet before they reached the town. He de-
layed doing this, however, first on one pretext, then on
another—till they arrived at their destination.
Anansi, being dressed in such a fine garment,
found no difficulty in getting as many wives as he
wished. Poor Nothing, with his ragged and miserable
cloth, was treated with great contempt. At first he
could not get even one wife. At last, however, a
woman took pity on him and gave him her daughter.
The poor girl was laughed at very heartily by Anansi’s
wives for choosing such a beggar as Nothing appeared
to be. She wisely took no notice of their scorn.
The party set off for home. When they reached
the cross-roads leading to their respective houses the
women were astonished. The road leading to Anansi’s
house was only half cleared. The one which led to
Nothing’s palace was, of course, wide and well made.
Not only so, but his servants had strewn it with beauti-
ful skins and carpets, in preparation for his return. Ser-
vants were there, awaiting him, with fine clothes for
himself and his wife. No one was waiting for Anansi.
Nothing’s wife was queen over the whole dis-
trict and had everything her heart could desire. An-
ansi’s wives could not even get proper food; they had
to live on unripe bananas with peppers. The wife of
Nothing heard of her friends’ miserable state and in-
vited them to a great feast in her palace. They came,
and were so pleased with all they saw that they agreed
to stay there. Accordingly, they refused to come back
to Anansi’s hut.
He was very angry, and tried in many ways to
kill Nothing, but without success. Finally, however, he
persuaded some rat friends to dig a deep tunnel in
front of Nothing’s door. When the hole was finished
Anansi lined it with knives and broken bottles. He
then smeared the steps of the palace with okro to
make them very slippery, and withdrew to a little dis-
tance.
When he thought Nothing’s household was
safely in bed and asleep, he called to Nothing to come
out to the courtyard and see something. Nothing’s
wife, however, dissuaded him from going. Anansi tried
again and again, and each time she bade her husbandnot to listen. At last Nothing determined to go and see
this thing. As he placed his foot on the first step, of
course he slipped, and down he fell into the hole. The
noise alarmed the household. Lights were fetched and
Nothing was found in the ditch, so much wounded by
the knives that he soon died. His wife was terribly
grieved at his untimely death. She boiled many yams,
mashed them, and took a great dishful of them round
the district. To every child she met she gave some, so
that the child might help her to cry for her husband.
This is why, if you find a child crying and ask the
cause, you will often be told he is “crying for nothing.”
